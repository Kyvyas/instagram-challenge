Instagram Challenge
===================

Overview
-------
* Having spent the week learning how to use Rails, we were tasked with building a website which had the basic functionality of an instagram clone.
* This was a chance to practice: database associations, user authentication, styling and basic jquery
* I enjoyed this challenge in particular, databases are both frustrating and fascinating and building a fully tested web app that bore similarities to Instagram was incredibly satisfying.
